# DS-study-projects
Here are projects that I completed during my study of Data Science at Yandex.Praktikum.
The projects are written in Python and presented in Jupyter notebooks.

## [Project 1. Comments classifications](https://github.com/MaPl1/DS-study-projects/tree/main/1_comments_classification)
- Objective: to facilitate the moderation of comments by automating the assessment of toxicity. This is done by training a model to classify comments into positive and negative.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, regex, Sklearn, lgbm, logistic regression.
- Status: completed

## [Project 2. Car price prediction](https://github.com/MaPl1/DS-study-projects/tree/main/2_price_prediction)
- Objective: to build a model to determine the car value based on historical data: technical specifications, kits and prices of cars.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn, light gbm, logistic regression, random forest.
- Status: completed

## [Project 3. Exploratory analysis of game market](https://github.com/MaPl1/DS-study-projects/tree/main/3_game_market_analysis)
- Objective: to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This is done by analysing computer games data: sales, genres and platforms, user and critics rates.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing.
- Status: completed
