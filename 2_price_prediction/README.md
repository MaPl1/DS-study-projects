# Project 2. Car price prediction

## Scenario
A company that sells used cars is developing an application to attract new customers. In an aplplication one can quickly get the market value of the car. 
The following is important for the company:  

- quality of prediction;  
- the speed of prediction;  
- learning time.  

## Objective  
To build a model to determine the car value based on historical data: technical specifications, kits and prices of cars. 

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn, light gbm, logistic regression, random forest.

## Result
Data was preprocessed for model training. Three models were trained : Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Light GBM Rgressor. LightGBM model has the lowest RMSE metric and good performance time. 

It is necessary to clarify the acceptable rate of prediction and model learning for the customer.
